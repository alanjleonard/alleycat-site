					An alleycat is an unsanctioned bike race with multiple checkpoints and no set route. The Steel City Alleycat is a small part of a much bigger history of urban cycling. The history of alleycats starts in Toronto in the '80s and has since expanded world-wide. Originally it was a way for bike messengers to see who's the fastest. The race models the job of a bike messenger: In a city, no set route, several locations, get there fast. There's a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgTKIBFpVdE' target='_blank'>documentary on YouTube called First Cats</a> that talks about the Alleycat's chaotic origins.

					Traditionally, alleycat bike races are done on fixed gear bikes--since they were the preference of bike messengers. But I'm not going to police what you ride. In the past we've had e-bikes, multiple tandem bikes, kid-trailers, recumbent bikes, SoBis, dogs, big teams, elite-level bikes, and dumpster-ready-shit-boxes. Riders from under one year old to over 70 years old.
