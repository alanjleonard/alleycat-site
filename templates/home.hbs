        <p>
        An alleycat is an unsanctioned bike race with multiple
        checkpoints and no set route. It's like a scavenger hunt for
        locations in Hamilton. It's history starts in Toronto in the
        '80s and has since expanded world-wide. Originally it was a way
        for bike messengers to see who the fastest was. The race models
        the job of a bike messenger: In a city, no set route, several
        locations. The Steel City Alleycat is a small part of a much
        bigger history of urban cycling. There's

        Traditionally, alleycat bike races are done on fixed gear
        bikes&mdash;since this was a prefered bike of messengers, but
        I'm not going to police what you ride. In the past we've had
        e-bikes, multiple tandem bikes, kid-trailers, recumbent bikes,
        SoBis, dogs, big teams, elite level bikes, and
        dumpster-ready-shit-boxes. Riders from under one year old to
        over 70 years old.

        I don't care who you are. I'll never ask for your email address,
        phone number, or real name. Just show up and ride.
