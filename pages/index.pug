					An <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleycat_race' target='_blank'>Alleycat</a> is an unsanctioned bike race with multiple checkpoints and no set route. The Steel City Alleycat is a small part of a much bigger history of urban cycling. The history of Alleycat races started in Toronto in the late '80s and has since expanded world-wide. Originally, it was a way for bike messengers to see who's the fastest. The race mirrors the job of a bike messenger: in a city, no set route, several locations, and get there fast. There's a documentary on YouTube called <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgTKIBFpVdE' target='blank'>First Cats</a> that talks about the Alleycat's chaotic origins.

					<strong>The Steel City Alleycat</strong> has 4 checkpoints and an unknown finish line when you start the race. Each checkpoint will give you information about where the finish line is. Everything you need to know about upcoming races <a href='/results.html#results'>and past results</a> will be on this site.

				p.body-text Traditionally, alleycat bike races are done on fixed gear bikes; since they were the preference of bike messengers.  I'm not going to police what you ride. In the past we've had e-bikes, multiple tandem bikes, kid-trailers, recumbent bikes, SoBis, dogs, big teams, elite-level bikes, and dumpster-ready-shit-boxes. There has been riders from less than a year old to over 70 years old.
